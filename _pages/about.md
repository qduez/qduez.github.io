I am currently a 'Chargé de Recherches' FNRS researcher in the Organic Synthesis and Mass Spectrometry Lab at the University of Mons (Belgium), led by [Pascal Gerbaux](https://staff.umons.ac.be/pascal.gerbaux/activites.html).

I am interested in **mass spectrometry**, **ion mobility spectrometry** and in developing approaches around these techniques to look at chemistry in new ways.

*From 2022-2023*, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Huck Group](https://www.hucklab.com/) at Radboud University (Nijmegen, The Netherlands).

*From 2020-2022*, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Roithová Group](https://www.roithova-group.com/) at Radboud University (Nijmegen, The Netherlands).

*From 2016-2020*, I was an 'Aspirant' FNRS PhD student in the Organic Synthesis and Mass Spectrometry Lab at the University of Mons (Belgium), under the joint supervision of Pascal Gerbaux and Jérôme Cornil.
