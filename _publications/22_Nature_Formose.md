excerpt: '
In this work, we demonstrated how the formose reaction can perform several computational tasks, including nonlinear classification tasks in parallel, predicting the dynamics of other complex systems and achieving time-series forecasting. The reservoir outputs were measured by an ion mobility mass spectrometer, highlighting the importance of online analytics for achieving chemical reservoir computation.'

Abstract:
Chemical reaction networks, such as those found in metabolism and signalling pathways, enable cells to process information from their environment. Current approaches to molecular information processing and computation typically pursue digital computation models and require extensive molecular-level engineering. Despite considerable advances, these approaches have not reached the level of information processing capabilities seen in living systems. Here we report on the discovery and implementation of a chemical reservoir computer based on the formose reaction. We demonstrate how this complex, self-organizing chemical reaction network can perform several nonlinear classification tasks in parallel, predict the dynamics of other complex systems and achieve time-series forecasting. This in chemico information processing system provides proof of principle for the emergent computational capabilities of complex chemical reaction networks, paving the way for a new class of biomimetic information processing systems.
