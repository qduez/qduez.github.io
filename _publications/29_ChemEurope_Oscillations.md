excerpt: 'Periodic perturbations, such as modulations of reactant concentration, propagate through chemical reactions with distinct phase delays. Tracking the propagation of such perturbations presents a powerful approach for probing reaction connectivity and rates of individual reaction steps, provided that high-throughput and information-rich analytical approaches are used. Here, we report on the online monitoring of periodic perturbations in the organocatalytic addition of cyclopentadiene to α,β-unsaturated aldehydes by Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Upon perturbation of input concentrations, ion intensities corresponding to substrates and reaction intermediates detected by ESI-MS exhibit characteristic time delays, providing quantitative insights into the kinetics of individual reaction steps, as supported by
numerical simulations.'
