Abstract :
Organic semiconductors are increasingly being used in organic-based opto-electronic devices. Since regioselective synthetic approaches are not always controlled, promising compounds are sometimes prepared following non-regioselective routes. Ion mobility mass spectrometry is here introduced as a direct method to distinguish isomers in mixtures, instead of undertaking time-consuming analytical chromatography procedures.
