excerpt: 'The survival of living systems relies on their ability to process complex physico-chemical information. Here, we introduce a scalable approach to design complex enzymatic reaction networks capable of reservoir computation based on recursive competition of substrates. As for the formose reservoir, Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry allows for a real-time readout of chemical outputs, which effectively enables to demonstrate the information processing capabilities of this molecular system.'
