excerpt: '
Here, we investigate the solution equilibria of labile pyridine ligands coordinated in the cavity of macrocyclic porphyrin cage complexes by ESI-MS. Using *delayed reactant labeling*, we could obtain rate constants and activation parameters for ligand dissociation in solution. With our approach, we gathered mechanistic evidence that are not easily obtained from traditional solution-phase techniques.'

Abstract:
Complex speciation and exchange kinetics of labile ligands are critical parameters for understanding the reactivity of metal complexes in solution. We present a novel approach to determine ligand exchange parameters based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The introduction of isotopically labelled ligands to a solution of metal host and unlabelled ligands allows the quantitative investigation of the solution-phase equilibria. Furthermore, ion mobility separation can target individual isomers, such as ligands bound at specific sites. As a proof of concept, we investigate the solution equilibria of labile pyridine ligands coordinated in the cavity of macrocyclic porphyrin cage complexes bearing diamagnetic or paramagnetic metal centres. The effects of solvent, porphyrin coordination sphere, transition metal, and counterion on ligand dissociation are discussed. Rate constants and activation parameters for ligand dissociation in the solution can be derived from our ESI-MS approach, thereby providing mechanistic insights that are not easily obtained from traditional solution-phase techniques.
