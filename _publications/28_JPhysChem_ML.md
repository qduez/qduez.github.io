excerpt: 'In this project, we hypothesized that ML models could be trained based on IMS-MS measurements to classify guests based on their propensity to form inclusion or exclusion complexes with a supramolecular host. By combining CCS measurements with DFT-derived molecular descriptors, we trained a regression model that accurately predicts CCS values. The predicted values naturally separate in two groups, representing the inclusion vs exclusion topologies, and enable to determine a classification boundary of complex topologies.'

Abstract:
Elucidating the topology of host–guest complexes is essential for the rational design of supramolecular assemblies. Building on the recent success of data-driven approaches, we evaluate the combination of ion mobility–mass spectrometry (IMS–MS), density functional theory (DFT) featurization, and machine learning to predict and classify the binding modes of 1:1 complexes formed between cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) and diamine guests. Training a regression model with DFT-derived molecular descriptors and experimentally determined collisional cross sections (CCS) enables predicting the CCS of host–guest complexes with a diverse set of diamine guests. The predicted values naturally separate in two distinct groups corresponding respectively to inclusion and exclusion complexes, thereby enabling topology classification. This approach demonstrates that DFT-featurization and IMS–MS data capture well host–guest topology and provide a framework for the data-driven design of supramolecular assemblies.
