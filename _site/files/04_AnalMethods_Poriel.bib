abstract  ="Organic semiconductors are increasingly being used in organic-based opto-electronic devices. Since regioselective synthetic approaches are not always controlled{,} promising compounds are sometimes prepared following non-regioselective routes. Ion mobility mass spectrometry is here introduced as a direct method to distinguish isomers in mixtures{,} instead of undertaking time-consuming analytical chromatography procedures."}
