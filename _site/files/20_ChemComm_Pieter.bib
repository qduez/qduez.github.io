abstract  ="The kinetic enantio-recognition of chiral viologen guests by planar-chiral porphyrin cage compounds{,} measured in terms of ΔΔG‡on{,} is determined by the planar-chirality of the host and influenced by the size{,} as measured by ion mobility-mass spectrometry{,} but not the chirality of its substituents."}
