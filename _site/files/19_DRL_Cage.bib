abstract  ="Complex speciation and exchange kinetics of labile ligands are critical parameters for understanding the reactivity of metal complexes in solution. We present a novel approach to determine ligand exchange parameters based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The introduction of isotopically labelled ligands to a solution of metal host and unlabelled ligands allows the quantitative investigation of the solution-phase equilibria. Furthermore{,} ion mobility separation can target individual isomers{,} such as ligands bound at specific sites. As a proof of concept{,} we investigate the solution equilibria of labile pyridine ligands coordinated in the cavity of macrocyclic porphyrin cage complexes bearing diamagnetic or paramagnetic metal centres. The effects of solvent{,} porphyrin coordination sphere{,} transition metal{,} and counterion on ligand dissociation are discussed. Rate constants and activation parameters for ligand dissociation in the solution can be derived from our ESI-MS approach{,} thereby providing mechanistic insights that are not easily obtained from traditional solution-phase techniques."}
